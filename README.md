# 🤖 CareerPrep – AI-Powered Mock Interview Platform (MERN)

AI Interview Prep is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack that enables users to simulate real-world technical and HR interviews. Users can select specific job roles and attempt dynamically generated AI-based interview questions through a clean, responsive, and modern interface.

The platform focuses on structured interview practice, secure authentication, and session-based interview management.
